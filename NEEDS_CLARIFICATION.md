# TODOs Requiring Clarification

## Overview
This document tracks TODO items that require further clarification before implementation can proceed. Each item includes the original TODO, questions that need answering, and potential approaches.

## P1 - High Priority Items Needing Clarification

### 1. Natural Language Test Specification Support
**Original TODO**: Add natural language test specification support

**Questions Requiring Clarification**:
- What format should natural language test specifications take? (e.g., Gherkin, plain English, structured format?)
- Should this integrate with existing test frameworks or create a new DSL?
- What level of complexity should be supported in natural language descriptions?
- How should ambiguous language be handled?

**Potential Approaches**:
1. Gherkin-style Given/When/Then format
2. Free-form English with AI interpretation
3. Structured templates with fill-in-the-blank approach

**Stakeholders to Consult**: Product Owner, QA Team

### 2. AI-Driven Test Assertion Generation
**Original TODO**: Implement AI-driven test assertion generation

**Questions Requiring Clarification**:
- What types of assertions should be automatically generated?
- How should the AI determine what to assert on?
- Should assertions be suggested or automatically applied?
- What confidence threshold should trigger manual review?

**Potential Approaches**:
1. Generate assertions based on page state changes
2. Use historical test data to predict common assertions
3. AI analysis of user stories to derive assertions

**Stakeholders to Consult**: QA Lead, Development Team

### 3. Conversational Interaction with Agents
**Original TODO**: Add conversational interaction with agents

**Questions Requiring Clarification**:
- What conversation patterns should be supported?
- Should agents maintain conversation history/context?
- How should multi-turn conversations be handled?
- What commands or queries should agents respond to?

**Potential Approaches**:
1. Command-based interaction (e.g., "explore login flow")
2. Q&A style for test insights
3. Interactive debugging sessions

**Stakeholders to Consult**: UX Designer, Developer Experience Team

## P2 - Medium Priority Items Needing Clarification

### 4. AI-Powered Visual Regression Testing
**Original TODO**: Implement AI-powered visual regression testing

**Questions Requiring Clarification**:
- What constitutes a "significant" visual change?
- Should the AI learn from user feedback on false positives?
- How should dynamic content be handled?
- What baseline management strategy should be used?

**Potential Approaches**:
1. Perceptual diff with AI-determined thresholds
2. Semantic understanding of UI components
3. Layout-aware comparison ignoring cosmetic changes

**Stakeholders to Consult**: Design Team, QA Team

---

### 5. Smart Test Coverage Recommendations
**Original TODO**: Create smart test coverage recommendations

**Questions Requiring Clarification**:
- What metrics define "good" test coverage?
- Should recommendations be based on code analysis, user flows, or both?
- How should critical paths be identified?
- What format should recommendations take?

**Potential Approaches**:
1. Risk-based coverage analysis
2. User journey mapping to test coverage
3. Code complexity analysis for test prioritization

**Stakeholders to Consult**: Engineering Manager, Product Owner

### 6. Multi-Agent Collaborative Exploration
**Original TODO**: Enable multi-agent collaborative exploration

**Questions Requiring Clarification**:
- How should agents coordinate their activities?
- What communication protocol should agents use?
- How to prevent duplicate work or conflicts?
- Should there be a hierarchy or peer-to-peer collaboration?

**Potential Approaches**:
1. Master-worker pattern with task distribution
2. Peer-to-peer with shared state management
3. Specialized agents for different exploration aspects

**Stakeholders to Consult**: Architecture Team, Performance Team

## Technical Implementation Questions

### General AI Integration
1. **Model Selection**: Which AI models should be used for different tasks?
2. **Performance Budget**: What are acceptable latency thresholds for AI operations?
3. **Fallback Strategy**: How should the system behave when AI services are unavailable?
4. **Cost Management**: What's the budget for AI API calls?

### Integration Architecture
1. **State Management**: How should AI agent state be persisted across sessions?
2. **Scaling Strategy**: How to handle concurrent AI operations?
3. **Caching Policy**: What AI responses should be cached and for how long?

## Next Steps for Clarification

1. **Schedule Stakeholder Meetings**: Set up sessions with identified stakeholders
2. **Create POCs**: Build small prototypes for high-uncertainty items
3. **Document Decisions**: Record clarifications in implementation-log.md
4. **Update TODOs**: Move clarified items back to main TODO.md with specifications
