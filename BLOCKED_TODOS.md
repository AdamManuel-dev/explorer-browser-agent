## ðŸŸ¡ P1 - High Priority Items (Partially Blocked)

### 2. AI-Powered Element Detection
**Status**: PARTIALLY BLOCKED
**Original TODOs**:
- Replace selector-based detection with Stagehand observe API
- Implement natural language element queries
- Add context-aware element identification
- Enable self-adapting element detection for UI changes
- Remove hardcoded CSS selectors from AIElementDetector

**Blockers**:
1. **Performance Concerns**: AI element detection adds 150-200ms latency per operation

**Proposed Resolution**:
1. Implement intelligent caching layer for repeated elements
2. Batch element detection requests where possible
3. Create hybrid approach using AI + fallback selectors

**Estimated Unblock Date**: 2025-07-30

**Status**: BLOCKED
**Original TODOs**:
- Implement AI-powered test repair when selectors break
- Add automatic test optimization using AI analysis
- Enable dynamic assertion adjustment
- Build test resilience through AI adaptation
- Create feedback loop for test improvements

**Blockers**:
1. **Test History Storage**: No system for storing test execution history
2. **AI Training Data**: Insufficient data for training self-healing models
3. **Change Detection**: Unable to differentiate intentional vs. breaking changes

**Dependencies**:
- Test execution database schema design
- Minimum 1000 test runs for training data
- Product decision on change detection strategy

**Proposed Resolution**:
1. Design and implement test history storage system
