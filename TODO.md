# Browser Explorer Agent - Todo List

## Project Setup & Configuration
- [x] Initialize project structure with TypeScript, Node.js, and necessary dependencies (Mastra, Stagehand, Playwright)
- [x] Configure TypeScript, ESLint, Jest, and development environment
- [x] Set up Docker and docker-compose for development environment with Redis and PostgreSQL
- [x] Create Docker build pipeline and container registry setup

## Core Crawling Infrastructure
- [x] Implement BreadthFirstCrawler class with queue-based BFS algorithm and URL normalization
- [x] Create AIElementDetector class using Stagehand's observe tool for element detection
- [x] Implement InteractionExecutor with strategies for all element types (forms, buttons, dropdowns, etc.)
- [x] Build UserPathRecorder for capturing complete interaction sequences with timing and screenshots
- [x] Create ResilientCrawler with circuit breaker and retry policies

## Test Generation System
- [x] Create TestGenerator engine for converting recorded paths to Playwright TypeScript tests
- [x] Build test file writer with proper directory structure and formatting
- [x] Implement Page Object Model generator for maintainable test structure
- [x] Create TestDataGenerator using faker.js for realistic test data
- [x] Implement TestValidator for syntax and assertion validation

## Mastra AI Agents
- [ ] Implement Mastra Explorer Agent with web exploration capabilities
- [ ] Create Mastra Planner Agent for orchestrating crawl strategies
- [ ] Build Mastra Generator Agent for test generation coordination
- [ ] Implement exploration workflow using Mastra's workflow system

## Authentication & Session Management
- [x] Build MultiStrategyAuthManager supporting basic, OAuth, MFA, and API key authentication
- [x] Implement SessionManager for persisting and restoring authentication state

## Configuration & CLI
- [x] Create configuration management system with YAML/JSON support
- [x] Implement CLI interface for running the agent with various options

## Anti-Bot & Security
- [x] Implement StealthMode for anti-bot detection evasion
- [x] Build CaptchaHandler for CAPTCHA detection and handling

## Scalability & Performance
- [x] Build ResourceManager for browser pool and memory optimization
- [x] Implement DistributedCrawler with Redis queue for scalability

## Monitoring & Reporting
- [x] Create TestReporter for generating coverage and quality reports
- [x] Create MonitoringService with metrics collection and tracing

## Testing & Validation
- [x] Write comprehensive unit tests for all core classes
- [x] Create integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- [x] Build SelfTestRunner for validating the agent's own functionality
- [x] Build example test sites for testing the agent

## Documentation & CI/CD
- [x] Write comprehensive README with setup instructions and usage examples
- [x] Create API documentation for all public interfaces
- [ ] Write READMEs for each of the sections above
- [x] Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with automated testing

## Completed

- [x] Initialize npm project with TypeScript
- [x] Set up TypeScript configuration
- [x] Install core dependencies (Playwright/Puppeteer)
- [x] Create basic project structure
- [x] Implement basic browser agent class

## Implementation Notes

### Current Status
- Basic project structure created with src/agents, src/utils, src/config, src/types directories
- Basic BrowserAgent class implemented with Playwright
- Logger utility set up with Winston
- TypeScript configuration complete

### Next Steps
1. Start with Mastra AI framework integration to enable AI-powered browsing
2. Implement the BFS crawler for systematic website exploration
3. Integrate Stagehand for intelligent element detection
