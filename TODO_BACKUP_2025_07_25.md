1. Install Stagehand and configure with project
2. Refactor one agent (ExplorerAgent) to proper Mastra implementation
3. Create tool wrappers for Stagehand integration
4. Test basic AI-powered exploration on simple sites
5. Validate natural language element detection

### Phase 2: Full AI Rollout (2-3 weeks)
1. Convert all agents to proper Mastra agents
2. Implement complete Stagehand tool integration
3. Add natural language test generation
4. Build self-healing test capabilities
5. Enable workflow AI coordination

### Phase 3: Production Readiness (1-2 weeks)
1. Performance optimization for AI calls
2. Comprehensive testing of AI features
3. Documentation updates for AI capabilities
4. CI/CD integration for AI components
5. Production deployment preparation

## 🔧 Technical Debt to Address

1. Remove all `as any` TypeScript bypasses in agent files
2. Delete placeholder agent implementations
3. Remove hardcoded selectors from detectors
4. Update imports to include Stagehand
5. Refactor workflow system to Mastra standards

## 📝 Next Immediate Actions
